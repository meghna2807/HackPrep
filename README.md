# HackPrep

HackPrep is a full-stack MERN application that helps students generate hackathon project ideas based on a selected domain. The application ranks ideas using a rule-based scoring algorithm and provides an implementation roadmap for each idea.

## Features

- Generate hackathon project ideas based on domain
- Rule-based scoring engine
- Automatic ranking of ideas
- Implementation roadmap generation
- Input validation using Zod
- In-memory caching for faster repeated requests
- RESTful API architecture

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- Vite
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JavaScript
- Zod
- Axios
- Git
- GitHub
- Postman

## How It Works

1. The user selects a domain and specifies the number of ideas to generate.
2. React sends a POST request to the backend using Axios.
3. Express receives the request.
4. Zod validates the request body.
5. The controller invokes the Idea Engine.
6. The Idea Engine:
   - Maps aliases to supported domains.
   - Checks the cache for existing results.
   - Loads predefined project ideas.
   - Calculates scores.
   - Ranks ideas.
   - Generates an implementation roadmap.
   - Returns the top N ideas.
7. The frontend displays the generated ideas and roadmaps.

## Scoring Formula

```
Score = Impact + Feasibility − Complexity
```

Each project idea is evaluated based on:

- Impact
- Feasibility
- Complexity

The highest-scoring ideas are returned first.

---

## Cache

HackPrep uses an in-memory cache implemented using JavaScript's `Map` object.
Repeated requests with the same input return cached results instead of recalculating them.

---

## Validation

Input validation is implemented using Zod.

Rules:
- `topN` is mandatory
- `topN` must be a positive number.
- Maximum value of `topN` is 10.
